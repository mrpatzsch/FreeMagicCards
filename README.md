FREE MAGIC CARDS .com

Every day, all over this country, magic cards are being thrown away.  When people draft (open packs and build decks) or just straight up open packs, they inevitably accrue more than enough of some commons, maybe uncommons.  

FreeMagicCards.com serves as an exchange for magic cards between people who want to give them away and people who would like to have them.  

There are two ways I want to be able to deliver these cards.  
Shipping - within the U.S., I will have certain size/price packages that I will work out with the Post Office.  I’m considering taking a percentage of the “shipping fees” as a source of income.  
Drop Off / Pick Up - working with local stores or at individuals’ locations people can pick up cards
This is basically like a craigslist for magic cards, but I want to keep it simple.  
location
must have city and zipcode
amount and some basic details of what the cards are
I will also want to populate a database with all the magic stores in the United States.  

The website will also have links to magic formats that use only commons and/or uncommons.  There will also be a blog about “Card of the Week” or something.  

It has been suggested that I partner up with a non-profit to legitimize it and offer tax write-offs for people who donate.
